Look at the $n$-dimensional oscillator,
using only the controllable-but-not-observable degrees of freedom
in the Kalman decomposition.
And still keeping $B$ and $C$ fixed.

Goal is to to create a plot like Fig 6
of hybrid incompatibility against distance.

Do this for $n=3$ and $n=10$.

1. Start with one particular system, A0 (maybe the one you get by just adding zeros
to the two-dimensional one).
2. Pick a random epsilon between 0 and 0.1 (say), that will be the size of the noise.
3. Pick indept random Normals to put in all the free parameter spots, and multiply these all by epsilon, get a new matrix A.
4. Measure mean-sq-distance from A to A0.
5. Measure F1 and F2 incompatibility (for a bunch of random F2s).
6. Repeat.

Think about whether the right comparison of Fig 6 between systems in different dimensions
has x-axis |A-A0| or mean difference per entry of A.
