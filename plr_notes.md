*General:*

- where to put Kalman?
- point about unknown popgen params: epistasis, DFE, G matrix, 
- somewhere point out that we follow same logic as DMIs but in quantitative genetics

*Intro:*

#- says that 'math is better!' but not why
#- cite draghi and whitlock
#- use phrase "input-output equivalent"? as these are not equiv in terms of robustness etc
#- tighten up last sentence or two
#- say that here we do neutral evolution but framework could be used for nonneutral 
#    or tone down "framework for evolution"

*Model I:*

#- should we talk about GRNs for concreteness?
#- eq'n 1 assumes linearity but haven't said that yet
#- introduce diff eqns before eq'n (2)
#- how is $\ell=1$ without loss of generality?
#- unclear about paragraph before eqn (8)
- foreshadow genetic drift section
#- better justification of keeping $B$, $C$ fixed

*Phenotypic invariance:*

#- move 'two questions' earlier? (intro?)
#- say eq'ns (16-18) in words

*Speciation:*

#- would help to have made the connection of rows of $A$ to promoter regions earlier
#- justify why F1 is average of parental $A$s
#- replace biological species concept with defn of incompat
#- should leave example of crossing A(0) with A(2) as extreme but helpful example?
#- improve F2 notation
- Example 9: specify B,C and say what these are in higher dim'ns

*GAL:*

- decide how tightly should actually be connected to GAL network vs abstract. 
    perhaps start with verbal description of the network then write down matrices
    so the logic is clearer.  like: "here is a model that captures the general regulatory logic"?


*Discussion:*

#- remove the word 'novel'
