The problem of parameter identifiability for such systems is approached by considering whether system outputs obtained with different parameter values can be distinguished one from another. The results are stated formally by defining the notion of "output distinguishability." Parameter identifiability is then defined precisely in terms of output distinguishability. Relationships have been developed with the other definitions such as least square identifiability and identifiability from the transfer function. Several results for linear and nonlinear systems are presented with examples.},

  abstract="A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 − 10 = 70% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these “functional” regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used “causal role” definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as “affirming the consequent,” by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between “junk DNA” and “garbage DNA,” by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten."

  abstract="In a recent opinion piece, Denis Duboule has claimed that the increasing shift towards systems biology is driving evolutionary and developmental biology apart, and that a true reunification of these two disciplines within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) may easily take another 100 years. He identifies methodological, epistemological, and social differences as causes for this supposed separation. Our article provides a contrasting view. We argue that Duboule’s prediction is based on a one-sided understanding of systems biology as a science that is only interested in functional, not evolutionary, aspects of biological processes. Instead, we propose a research program for an evolutionary systems biology, which is based on local exploration of the configuration space in evolving developmental systems. We call this approach—which is based on reverse engineering, simulation, and mathematical analysis—the natural history of configuration space. We discuss a number of illustrative examples that demonstrate the past success of local exploration, as opposed to global mapping, in different biological contexts. We argue that this pragmatic mode of inquiry can be extended and applied to the mathematical analysis of the developmental repertoire and evolutionary potential of evolving developmental mechanisms and that evolutionary systems biology so conceived provides a pragmatic epistemological framework for the EvoDevo synthesis."

  abstract="Most complex trait-associated variants are located in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome, where they have been shown to disrupt transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs. Variable TF-DNA interactions are therefore increasingly considered as key drivers of phenotypic variation. However, recent genome-wide studies revealed that the majority of variable TF-DNA binding events are not driven by sequence alterations in the motif of the studied TF. This observation implies that the molecular mechanisms underlying TF-DNA binding variation and, by extrapolation, inter-individual phenotypic variation are more complex than originally anticipated. Here, we summarize the findings that led to this important paradigm shift and review proposed mechanisms for local, proximal, or distal genetic variation-driven variable TF-DNA binding. In addition, we discuss the biomedical implications of these findings for our ability to dissect the molecular role(s) of non-coding genetic variants in complex traits, including disease susceptibility."

  abstract="The basic body plan and major physiological axes have been highly conserved during mammalian evolution, yet only a small fraction of the human genome sequence appears to be subject to evolutionary constraint. To quantify cis- versus trans-acting contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining ~8.6 million transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is ~95% similar with that derived from human TF footprints. However, only ~20% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity."

We found that the mouse and human genomes have undergone extensive cis-regulatory rewiring that combines branch-specific evolutionary innovation and loss with widespread repurposing of conserved DHSs to alternative cell fates, and that this process is mediated by turnover of transcription factor (TF) recognition elements. Despite pervasive evolutionary remodeling of the location and content of individual cis-regulatory regions, within orthologous mouse and human cell types the global fraction of regulatory DNA bases encoding recognition sites for each TF has been strictly conserved.

  abstract="Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data."

  abstract="Cryptic genetic variants that do not typically influence traits can interact epistatically with each other and mutations to cause unexpected phenotypes. To improve understanding of the genetic architectures and molecular mechanisms that underlie these interactions, we comprehensively dissected the genetic bases of 17 independent instances of the same cryptic colony phenotype in a yeast cross. In eight cases, the phenotype resulted from a genetic interaction between a de novo mutation and one or more cryptic variants. The number and identities of detected cryptic variants depended on the mutated gene. In the nine remaining cases, the phenotype arose without a de novo mutation due to two different classes of higher-order genetic interactions that only involve cryptic variants. Our results may be relevant to other species and disease, as most of the mutations and cryptic variants identified in our study reside in components of a partially conserved and oncogenic signalling pathway."

  abstract="Genetic heterogeneity occurs when individuals express similar phenotypes as a result of different underlying mechanisms. Although such heterogeneity is known to be a potential source of unexplained heritability in genetic mapping studies, its prevalence and molecular basis are not fully understood. Here we show that substantial genetic heterogeneity underlies a model phenotype—the ability to grow invasively—in a cross of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The heterogeneous basis of this trait across genotypes and environments makes it difficult to detect causal loci with standard genetic mapping techniques. However, using selective genotyping in the original cross, as well as in targeted backcrosses, we detected four loci that contribute to differences in the ability to grow invasively. Identification of causal genes at these loci suggests that they act by changing the underlying regulatory architecture of invasion. We verified this point by deleting many of the known transcriptional activators of invasion, as well as the gene encoding the cell surface protein Flo11 from five relevant segregants and showing that these individuals differ in the genes they require for invasion. Our work illustrates the extensive genetic heterogeneity that can underlie a trait and suggests that regulatory rewiring is a basic mechanism that gives rise to this heterogeneity."

  abstract="Some genetic polymorphisms have phenotypic effects that are masked under most conditions, but can be revealed by mutations or environmental change. The genetic and molecular mechanisms that suppress and uncover these cryptic genetic variants are important to understand. Here, we show that a single mutation in a yeast cross causes a major phenotypic change through its genetic interactions with two specific combinations of cryptic variants in six genes. This result suggests that in some cases cryptic variants themselves play roles in revealing their own phenotypic effects through their genetic interactions with each other and the mutations that reveal them. We also demonstrate that most of the genes harboring cryptic variation in our system are transcription factors, a finding that supports an important role for perturbation of gene regulatory networks in the uncovering of cryptic variation. As a final part of our study, we interrogate how a mutation exposes combinations of cryptic variants and obtain evidence that it does so by disrupting the silencing of one or more genes that must be expressed for the cryptic variants to exert their effects. To prove this point, we delete the transcriptional repressor that mediates this silencing and demonstrate that this deletion reveals a similar set of cryptic variants to the ones that were discovered in the initial mutant background. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that reveal cryptic variation."

I focus on genetic and molecular evidence, which provides us with an almost-complete picture of the regulatory interactions responsible for trunk gap gene expression. I discuss the regulatory mechanisms involved, and highlight the remaining ambiguities and gaps in the evidence. This is followed by a brief discussion of molecular regulatory mechanisms for transcriptional regulation, as well as precision and size-regulation provided by the system. Finally, I discuss evidence on the evolution of gap gene expression from species other than Drosophila. My survey concludes that studies of the gap gene system continue to reveal interesting and important new insights into the role of gene regulatory networks in development and evolution."

  abstract="Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks."

  abstract="Transcription regulation networks control the expression of genes. The transcription networks of well-studied microorganisms appear to be made up of a small set of recurring regulation patterns, called network motifs. The same network motifs have recently been found in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans, suggesting that they serve as basic building blocks of transcription networks. Here I review network motifs and their functions, with an emphasis on experimental studies. Network motifs in other biological networks are also mentioned, including signalling and neuronal networks."

  abstract="Many signaling systems show adaptation—the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks."
