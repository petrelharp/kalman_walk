The problem of parameter identifiability for such systems is approached by considering whether system outputs obtained with different parameter values can be distinguished one from another. The results are stated formally by defining the notion of "output distinguishability." Parameter identifiability is then defined precisely in terms of output distinguishability. Relationships have been developed with the other definitions such as least square identifiability and identifiability from the transfer function. Several results for linear and nonlinear systems are presented with examples.},

  abstract="A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80\% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 − 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these “functional” regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used “causal role” definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as “affirming the consequent,” by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between “junk DNA” and “garbage DNA,” by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten."

  abstract="In a recent opinion piece, Denis Duboule has claimed that the increasing shift towards systems biology is driving evolutionary and developmental biology apart, and that a true reunification of these two disciplines within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) may easily take another 100 years. He identifies methodological, epistemological, and social differences as causes for this supposed separation. Our article provides a contrasting view. We argue that Duboule’s prediction is based on a one-sided understanding of systems biology as a science that is only interested in functional, not evolutionary, aspects of biological processes. Instead, we propose a research program for an evolutionary systems biology, which is based on local exploration of the configuration space in evolving developmental systems. We call this approach—which is based on reverse engineering, simulation, and mathematical analysis—the natural history of configuration space. We discuss a number of illustrative examples that demonstrate the past success of local exploration, as opposed to global mapping, in different biological contexts. We argue that this pragmatic mode of inquiry can be extended and applied to the mathematical analysis of the developmental repertoire and evolutionary potential of evolving developmental mechanisms and that evolutionary systems biology so conceived provides a pragmatic epistemological framework for the EvoDevo synthesis."

  abstract="Most complex trait-associated variants are located in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome, where they have been shown to disrupt transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs. Variable TF-DNA interactions are therefore increasingly considered as key drivers of phenotypic variation. However, recent genome-wide studies revealed that the majority of variable TF-DNA binding events are not driven by sequence alterations in the motif of the studied TF. This observation implies that the molecular mechanisms underlying TF-DNA binding variation and, by extrapolation, inter-individual phenotypic variation are more complex than originally anticipated. Here, we summarize the findings that led to this important paradigm shift and review proposed mechanisms for local, proximal, or distal genetic variation-driven variable TF-DNA binding. In addition, we discuss the biomedical implications of these findings for our ability to dissect the molecular role(s) of non-coding genetic variants in complex traits, including disease susceptibility."

  abstract="Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data."

  abstract="Cryptic genetic variants that do not typically influence traits can interact epistatically with each other and mutations to cause unexpected phenotypes. To improve understanding of the genetic architectures and molecular mechanisms that underlie these interactions, we comprehensively dissected the genetic bases of 17 independent instances of the same cryptic colony phenotype in a yeast cross. In eight cases, the phenotype resulted from a genetic interaction between a de novo mutation and one or more cryptic variants. The number and identities of detected cryptic variants depended on the mutated gene. In the nine remaining cases, the phenotype arose without a de novo mutation due to two different classes of higher-order genetic interactions that only involve cryptic variants. Our results may be relevant to other species and disease, as most of the mutations and cryptic variants identified in our study reside in components of a partially conserved and oncogenic signalling pathway."

  abstract="Genetic heterogeneity occurs when individuals express similar phenotypes as a result of different underlying mechanisms. Although such heterogeneity is known to be a potential source of unexplained heritability in genetic mapping studies, its prevalence and molecular basis are not fully understood. Here we show that substantial genetic heterogeneity underlies a model phenotype—the ability to grow invasively—in a cross of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The heterogeneous basis of this trait across genotypes and environments makes it difficult to detect causal loci with standard genetic mapping techniques. However, using selective genotyping in the original cross, as well as in targeted backcrosses, we detected four loci that contribute to differences in the ability to grow invasively. Identification of causal genes at these loci suggests that they act by changing the underlying regulatory architecture of invasion. We verified this point by deleting many of the known transcriptional activators of invasion, as well as the gene encoding the cell surface protein Flo11 from five relevant segregants and showing that these individuals differ in the genes they require for invasion. Our work illustrates the extensive genetic heterogeneity that can underlie a trait and suggests that regulatory rewiring is a basic mechanism that gives rise to this heterogeneity."

  abstract="Some genetic polymorphisms have phenotypic effects that are masked under most conditions, but can be revealed by mutations or environmental change. The genetic and molecular mechanisms that suppress and uncover these cryptic genetic variants are important to understand. Here, we show that a single mutation in a yeast cross causes a major phenotypic change through its genetic interactions with two specific combinations of cryptic variants in six genes. This result suggests that in some cases cryptic variants themselves play roles in revealing their own phenotypic effects through their genetic interactions with each other and the mutations that reveal them. We also demonstrate that most of the genes harboring cryptic variation in our system are transcription factors, a finding that supports an important role for perturbation of gene regulatory networks in the uncovering of cryptic variation. As a final part of our study, we interrogate how a mutation exposes combinations of cryptic variants and obtain evidence that it does so by disrupting the silencing of one or more genes that must be expressed for the cryptic variants to exert their effects. To prove this point, we delete the transcriptional repressor that mediates this silencing and demonstrate that this deletion reveals a similar set of cryptic variants to the ones that were discovered in the initial mutant background. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that reveal cryptic variation."

I discuss the regulatory mechanisms involved, and highlight the remaining ambiguities and gaps in the evidence. This is followed by a brief discussion of molecular regulatory mechanisms for transcriptional regulation, as well as precision and size-regulation provided by the system. Finally, I discuss evidence on the evolution of gap gene expression from species other than Drosophila.

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks."

More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks."

  abstract="Progress in science often begins with verbal hypotheses meant to explain why certain biological phenomena exist. An important purpose of mathematical models in evolutionary research, as in many other fields, is to act as “proof-of-concept” tests of the logic in verbal explanations, paralleling the way in which empirical data are used to test hypotheses. Because not all subfields of biology use mathematics for this purpose, misunderstandings of the function of proof-of-concept modeling are common. In the hope of facilitating communication, we discuss the role of proof-of-concept modeling in evolutionary biology."

  abstract="Species-specific regulation of gene expression contributes to the development and maintenance of reproductive isolation and to species differences in ecologically important traits. A better understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape regulatory variation and divergence can be developed by comparing expression differences among species and interspecific hybrids. Once expression differences are identified, the underlying genetics of regulatory variation or divergence can be explored. With the goal of associating cis and/or trans components of regulatory divergence with differences in gene expression, overall and allele-specific expression levels were assayed genomewide in female adult heads of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrids. A greater proportion of cis differences than trans differences were identified for genes expressed in heads and, in accordance with previous studies, cis differences also explained a larger number of species differences in overall expression level. Regulatory divergence was found to be prevalent among genes associated with defense, olfaction, and among genes downstream of the Drosophila sex determination hierarchy. In addition, two genes, with critical roles in sex determination and micro RNA processing, Sxl and loqs, were identified as misexpressed in hybrid female heads, potentially contributing to hybrid incompatibility."

abstract="Cis-regulatory sequences are often composed of many low-affinity transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Determining the evolutionary and functional importance of regulatory sequence composition is impeded without a detailed knowledge of the genotype-phenotype map.

We simulate the evolution of regulatory sequences involved in Drosophila melanogaster embryo segmentation during early development. Natural selection evaluates gene expression dynamics produced by a computational model of the developmental network. We observe a dramatic decrease in the total number of transcription factor binding sites through the course of evolution. Despite a decrease in average sequence binding energies through time, the regulatory sequences tend towards organisations containing increased high affinity transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, the binding energies of separate sequence segments demonstrate ubiquitous mutual correlations through time. Fewer than 10\% of initial TFBSs are maintained throughout the entire simulation, deemed ‘core’ sites. These sites have increased functional importance as assessed under wild-type conditions and their binding energy distributions are highly conserved. Furthermore, TFBSs within close proximity of core sites exhibit increased longevity, reflecting functional regulatory interactions with core sites.

In response to elevated mutational pressure, evolution tends to sample regulatory sequence organisations with fewer, albeit on average, stronger functional transcription factor binding sites. These organisations are also shaped by the regulatory interactions among core binding sites with sites in their local vicinity.

  abstract="The interplay between the yeast prototypical transcriptional activator Gal4p and the inhibitor protein Gal80p determines the transcriptional status of the genes needed for galactose utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we showed that deletion of dsg1 coding for the F box protein Dsg1/Mdm30 delayed but did not eliminate growth of yeast on galactose. Correspondingly, the impaired expression of a GAL1-LacZ reporter in the absence of Dsg1 was only apparent during an early stage of induction. The requirement for Dsg1 in induction was abrogated by the absence of Gal80p or partly bypassed by Gal4 derivatives with decreased interaction with Gal80p. A K23R mutation in the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p was also identified to alleviate the induction defect by dsg1 deletion. On the other hand, the overall accumulation of multi-ubiquitylated Gal4p was not affected by the absence of dsg1 and the induction defect with deletion of dsg1 was partly rescued by disruption of dnm1, a gene encoding a component of the mitochondria division machinery. Taken together, these results suggest that the Dsg1-mediated efficient transcription process of GAL genes may depend on the interaction status between Gal4p and Gal80p."

Here we demonstrate that these two functions are separable by single amino acid changes within this region. We determined the sequences of four GAL4C-mutations, and characterized the abilities of the encoded GAL4C proteins to activate transcription of the galactose/melibiose regulon in the presence of GAL80 and superrepressible GAL80S alleles. One of the GAL4C mutations can be compensated by a specific GAL80S mutation, resulting in a wild-type phenotype. These results support the idea that while the GAL4 activation function tolerates at least minor alterations in the GAL4 carboxyl terminus, the GAL80-interactive function is highly sequence-specific and sensitive even to single amino acid alterations. They also argue that the GAL80S mutations affect the affinity of GAL80 for GAL4, and not the ability of GAL80 to bind inducer."

  abstract="In S. cerevisiae, following the Whole Genome Duplication (WGD), GAL1-encoded galactokinase retained its signal transduction function but lost basal expression. On the other hand, its paralogue GAL3, lost kinase activity but retained its signalling function and basal expression, thus making it indispensable for the rapid induction of the S. cerevisiae GAL switch. However, a gal3Δ strain exhibits delayed growth kinetics due to the redundant signalling function of GAL1. The subfunctionalization between the paralogues GAL1 and GAL3 is due to expression divergence and is proposed to be due to the alteration in the Upstream Activating Sequences (UASG). We demonstrate that the GAL switch becomes independent of GAL3 by altering the interaction between Gal4p and Gal80p without altering the configuration of UASG. In addition to the above, the altered switch of S. cerevisiae loses ultrasensitivity and stringent glucose repression. These changes caused an increase in fitness in the disaccharide melibiose at the expense of a decrease in fitness in galactose. The above altered features of the ScGAL switch are similar to the features of the GAL switch of K. lactis that diverged from S. cerevisiae before the WGD."

However, in C. albicans, the Gal4p and UASG combination is found to regulate genes unrelated to galactose metabolism. We identified a palindromic sequence that acts to control GAL10 expression in C. albicans in the presence of galactose. This palindrome is found upstream of other Leloir-pathway genes in C. albicans, and in the absence of other regulatory sequences, activation of expression through this sequence in the presence of galactose requires Cph1p, the homolog of the Ste12p transcription factor of S. cerevisiae."

Here we consider the transcriptional ‘rewiring’ of the three GAL genes that encode the enzymes needed for cells to convert galactose to glucose. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcriptional regulator Gal4 binds and activates these genes. In the human pathogen Candida albicans (which last shared a common ancestor with S. cerevisiae some 300 million years ago), we show that different regulators, Rtg1 and Rtg3, activate the three GAL genes. Using single-cell dynamics and RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that although the overall logic of regulation is the same in both species—the GAL genes are induced by galactose—there are major differences in both the quantitative response of these genes to galactose and in the position of these genes in the overall transcription network structure of the two species."

Transcription of the ribosomal regulon is a critical task for all cells; in S. cerevisiae the transcription factors Rap1, Fhl1, Ifh1, and Hmo1 form a multi-subunit complex that controls ribosomal gene expression, while in C. albicans this regulation is under the control of Tbf1 and Cbf1. Here, we analyzed, using full-genome transcription factor mapping, the roles, in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, of each orthologous component of this complete set of regulators. We observe dramatic changes in the binding profiles of the generalist regulators Cbf1, Hmo1, Rap1, and Tbf1, while the Fhl1-Ifh1 dimer is the only component involved in ribosomal regulation in both fungi: it activates ribosomal protein genes and rDNA expression in a Tbf1-dependent manner in C. albicans and a Rap1-dependent manner in S. cerevisiae. We show that the transcriptional regulatory network governing the ribosomal expression program of two related yeast species has been massively reshaped in cis and trans. Changes occurred in transcription factor wiring with cellular functions, movements in transcription factor hierarchies, DNA-binding specificity, and regulatory complexes assembly to promote global changes in the architecture of the fungal transcriptional regulatory network."

Because the ultimate source of all genetic variation is mutation, the distribution of mutations entering populations profoundly affects standing variation and genetic correlations. Here, we use an individual-based simulation model to investigate how natural selection and gene interactions (i.e., epistasis) shape the evolution of mutational processes affecting complex traits. We find that the presence of epistasis allows natural selection to mold the distribution of mutations, such that mutational effects align with the selection surface. Consequently, novel mutations tend to be more compatible with the current forces of selection acting on the population. These results suggest that in many cases mutational effects should be seen as an outcome of natural selection rather than as an unbiased source of genetic variation that is independent of other evolutionary processes.},

Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

To quantify cis- versus trans-acting contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining [sim]8.6 million transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is [sim]95\% similar with that derived from human TF footprints. However, only [sim]20\% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data.},

The binding sites of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and a key regulator of immune responses, nuclear factor kappaB (p65), were mapped in 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines, and 25 and 7.5\% of the respective binding regions were found to differ between individuals. Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.},

Although each TF displays highly conserved DNA binding preferences, most binding is species-specific, and aligned binding events present in all five species are rare. Regions near genes with expression levels that are dependent on a TF are often bound by the TF in multiple species yet show no enhanced DNA sequence constraint. Binding divergence between species can be largely explained by sequence changes to the bound motifs. Among the binding events lost in one lineage, only half are recovered by another binding event within 10 kilobases.

Improving predictions may be dependent on expanding the set of bona fide TF binding alterations. Allele-specific binding (ASB) events, where TFs preferentially bind to one of the two alleles at heterozygous sites, reveal the impact of sequence variations in altered TF binding. Here, we present the largest ASB compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 ASB events retrieved from 45 ENCODE ChIP-Seq data sets. Our analysis showed that ASB events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the ChIP'ed TF and potential partner TFs, allelic difference of DNase I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For TF dimers bound symmetrically to DNA, ASB data revealed that central positions of the TF binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on TF binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of ASB events. Classification models using only DNase I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features. Taken together, the combination of ASB data and the classification model represents an important step toward elucidating regulatory variants across the human genome.},

Although individual mutations in bound sequence motifs can influence TF binding, most binding differences occur in the absence of nearby sequence variations. Instead, combinatorial binding was found to be significant for genetic and evolutionary stability; cobound TFs tend to disappear in concert and were sensitive to genetic knockout of partner TFs. The large, qualitative differences in genomic regions bound between closely related mammals, when contrasted with the smaller, quantitative TF binding differences among Drosophila species, illustrate how genome structure and population genetics together shape regulatory evolution.},

  abstract = {As species evolve along a phylogenetic tree, we expect closely related species to retain some phenotypic similarities due to their shared evolutionary histories. The amount of expected similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the covariance structure expected from several simple macroevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including various combinations of random genetic drift, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods. Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many processes in addition to random genetic drift, such as directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of punctuated change. Our framework can be used to develop methods for (1) phylogenetic reconstruction; (2) inference of the evolutionary process from comparative data; and (3) conducting or evaluating statistical analyses of comparative data while taking phylogenetic history into account.},

@article{felsenstein1988phylogenies,
  abstract = {Systematists and evolutionary geneticists don't often talk to each other, and
they routinely disparage each other's work as being of little relevance to
evolution. Systematists sometimes invoke the punctuationist argument that
most evolutionary change does not occur by individual selection and hence
that within-population phenomena are largely irrelevant to evolution. They
sometimes make the pattern-c1adist contention that evolutionary processes
cannot be inferred from any observation about pattern, nor can any knowledge
of evolutionary processes inform inferences about pattern. More frequently
systematists feel, with considerable justification, that evolutionary geneticists
have simply failed to concern themselves with morphological characters and
data on differences between species. Evolutionary geneticists in tum dismiss
the idea that studies comparing species anciently diverged, using morphological
characters far removed from the level of the gene and using nonquantitative
methods, can either be sound in their inferences of pattern or can shed
much light on evolutionary processes.
Changes in the methods of collecting and analyzing data are invalidating
some of these views. Molecular data, such as nucleic acid sequences, give us
observations at the gene level that are comparable across many species, and
consideration of these data has drawn population geneticists across the species
boundary. The availability of microcomputers and digitizers is leading to
more quantitation of morphological data by systematists, and the field of
morphometries, needed to derive meaningful characters from this flood of
digitized coordinates, is expanding rapidly. My argument is that the methods
used to study the evolution of quantitative characters within populations can
profitably be used on a phylogenetic scale to illumine the connection between
pattern and process. Futuyma (29) has reached much the same conclusion; so
have Atchley (2), Shaffer (51), and of course Lande (38, 39). The moment
seems ripe to consider the matter. },

  abstract = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

  abstract = {The mechanism by which genetic variability is maintained in natural populations
for quantitative characters is not well understood. Many observations show that
there is a considerable amount of genetic variability in a large population, and unless
the character is closely correlated with fitness the optimum is usually near the mean,
with fitness decreasing as the distance from the mean increases. Probably, Fisher'
was the first to investigate a model in which the fitness was assumed to decrease in
proportion to the squared deviation from the optimum. This model was also used
by Haldane2 and Wright.3 Robertson4 has shown that if genes are maintained by
overdominance, but act additively with respect to a quantitative character, then
the optimum is at the mean and the decrease of fitness is proportional to the squared
deviation from the optimum.
In all these treatments the relation between the mutation rate and the amount of
genetic variability maintained is either ambiguous or left out of consideration. The
purpose of this paper is to propose a new model which enables one to make predictions
about the relations between mutation rate, genotypic variance, and genetic
load or amount of selective elimination involved in the maintenance of genetic
variability.
Assumptions and Mathematical Formulation.-The basic assumptions are:
(1) At every locus involved with the quantitative character under discussion,
mutation can produce an infinite sequence of alleles. Every mutation may produce
a new allele different from the pre-existing ones.
(2) The effect of a new allele on the quantitative character is only slightly
different from the parent allele from which it was derived by a single mutational
step.
(3) The genes are additive with respect to their effect on the quantitative
character.
(4) The optimum phenotype is fixed, and fitness decreases in proportion to the
squared deviation from the optimum.},

@article{berg2014population,
  abstract = {The process of adaptation is of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. Within the last few decades, genotyping technologies and new statistical methods have given evolutionary biologists the ability to identify individual regions of the genome that are likely to have been important in this process. When adaptation occurs in traits that are underwritten by many genes, however, the genetic signals left behind are more diffuse, and no individual region of the genome is likely to show strong signatures of selection. Identifying this signature therefore requires a detailed annotation of sites associated with a particular phenotype. Here we develop and implement a suite of statistical methods to integrate this sort of annotation from genome wide association studies with allele frequency data from many populations, providing a powerful way to identify the signal of adaptation in polygenic traits. We apply our methods to test for the impact of selection on human height, skin pigmentation, body mass index, type 2 diabetes risk, and inflammatory bowel disease risk. We find relatively strong signals for height and skin pigmentation, moderate signals for inflammatory bowel disease, and comparatively little evidence for body mass index and type 2 diabetes risk.},

@article{ting2001incipient,
  abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster from Zimbabwe and nearby
 regions shows strong but asymmetric sexual isolation from its
 cosmopolitan counterparts. By creating stable chromosome-substitution
 lines, earlier studies were able to show that the two major autosomes
 have very large effects on both male mating success and female mating
 preference. In this study, we genetically dissect this sexual isolation
 by recombination analysis between a whole-chromosome substitution line
 (which carries a Zimbabwe-derived third chromosome) and a strain with
 seven visible markers on that chromosome. Four loci are responsible for
 male mating success and three others are found to control female mating
 preference. Because male and female traits are not closely linked,
 their strong association among isofemale lines is most likely a
 reflection of sexual selection in nature. The results suggest that a
 large number of behavioral loci may evolve concurrently in the
 incipient stage of speciation before other aspects of reproductive
 isolation (such as hybrid sterility) have become evident. The results
 shed light on the population genetic processes underlying the formation
 of nascent species, as well as modes of speciation.},

@article{barton2010natural,
  abstract = {If distinct biological species are to coexist in sympatry, they must be reproductively isolated and must exploit different limiting resources. A two-niche Levene model is analysed, in which habitat preference and survival depend on underlying additive traits. The population genetics of preference and viability are equivalent. However, there is a linear trade-off between the chances of settling in either niche, whereas viabilities may be constrained arbitrarily. With a convex trade-off, a sexual population evolves a single generalist genotype, whereas with a concave trade-off, disruptive selection favours maximal variance. A pure habitat preference evolves to global linkage equilibrium if mating occurs in a single pool, but remarkably, evolves to pairwise linkage equilibrium within niches if mating is within those niches{\textemdash}independent of the genetics. With a concave trade-off, the population shifts sharply between a unimodal distribution with high gene flow and a bimodal distribution with strong isolation, as the underlying genetic variance increases. However, these alternative states are only simultaneously stable for a narrow parameter range. A sharp threshold is only seen if survival in the {\textquoteleft}wrong{\textquoteright} niche is low; otherwise, strong isolation is impossible. Gene flow from divergent demes makes speciation much easier in parapatry than in sympatry. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society},

@article{barton2017infinitesimal,
  abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of polygenic variation through a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection can be approximated in two ways. In the ‘Gaussian’ approximation, a normal distribution of allelic effects is assumed at each locus. In the ‘House of Cards’ approximation, the effect of new mutations is assumed to be large compared with the spread of the existing distribution. These approximations were developed to describe models where alleles may have a continuous range of effects. However, previous analyses of models with only two alleles have predicted an equilibrium variance equal to that given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation. These analyses of biallelic models have assumed that, at equilibrium, the population mean is at the optimum. Here, it is shown that many stable equilibria may coexist, each giving a slight deviation from the optimum. Though the variance is given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation when the mean is at the optimum, it increases towards a value of the same order as that given by the ‘Gaussian’ approximation when the mean deviates from the optimum. Thus, the equilibrium variance cannot be predicted by any simple model, but depends on the previous history of the population.},

  abstract = {Research in speciation genetics has uncovered many robust patterns in intrinsic reproductive isolation, and fitness landscape models have been useful in interpreting these patterns. Here, we examine fitness landscapes based on Fisher's geometric model. Such landscapes are analogous to models of optimizing selection acting on quantitative traits, and have been widely used to study adaptation and the distribution of mutational effects. We show that, with a few modifications, Fisher's model can generate all of the major findings of introgression studies (including "speciation genes" with strong deleterious effects, complex epistasis and asymmetry), and the major patterns in overall hybrid fitnesses (including Haldane's Rule, the speciation clock, heterosis, hybrid breakdown, and male-female asymmetry in the F1). We compare our approach to alternative modeling frameworks that assign fitnesses to genotypes by identifying combinations of incompatible alleles. In some cases, the predictions are importantly different. For example, Fisher's model can explain conflicting empirical results about the rate at which incompatibilities accumulate with genetic divergence. In other cases, the predictions are identical. For example, the quality of reproductive isolation is little affected by the manner in which populations diverge.},

@article{sved1981twosex,
  abstract = {A Monte-Carlo simulation program is described for a polygenic mating model introduced in the first paper in this series (Sved 1981). The program is used to simulate the situation in laboratory experiments in which two strains are allowed to mass-mate, hybrids are artificially eliminated and the establishment of mating isolation is studied. It is shown that, if mating choice is sufficiently precise, a combination of chance fluctuation and selection can lead to divergence in mating behavior. However, for small population sizes, the variability would usually be considerably reduced by the time some divergence is established, leading to low eventual levels of isolation. For larger population sizes, on the other hand, it may take many generations for any divergence to be established.-A dissection of the selective forces involved in the divergence shows that the major force potentially responsible for initial selective response is the tendency for divergent females and males to reject mates from the wrong strain. However, this is nullified in mixed-strain matings by the tendency of such individuals equally to reject mates from the correct strain. To overcome this problem, it is suggested that the usual mixed-strain mating procedure be replaced by procedures specifically designed to select for rejection of interstrain matings. Two procedures are suggested for this, and computer simulation shows that one or other of the procedures will work under the assumptions of the mating model. Other possible outcomes of selection, including asymmetrical divergence, are discussed for cases in which the assumptions of the mating model are invalid.},

@article{simon2017coadapted,
  abstract = {Fitness landscape models play an important role in our understanding of speciation, hybridization and admixture. The simplest modeling approaches are best-suited to particular kinds of hybridization: either crosses between closely-related inbred lines, where hybrids are often fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where breakdown involves discrete incompatibilities of large effect. We study a fitness landscape based on Fisher{\textquoteright}s geometric model, and show that it naturally interpolates between these two approaches, while explaining surprising empirical patterns that have been observed in both regimes. The model also yields new predictions, which can be tested with genomic data, and without needing to identify individual loci with anomalous effects. We test these predictions with data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus and Drosophila), and the predictions are generally supported. Fisher{\textquoteright}s geometric model should be particularly useful for studying hybridization in an intermediate regime, where hybrid fitness might be influenced by allelic coadaptation and maladaptation in the parental lines, and where epistatic interactions might involve many loci of moderate effect.},

@article{martin2014fishers,
  abstract = {Models relating phenotype space to fitness (phenotype–fitness landscapes) have seen important developments recently. They can roughly be divided into mechanistic models (e.g., metabolic networks) and more heuristic models like Fisher’s geometrical model. Each has its own drawbacks, but both yield testable predictions on how the context (genomic background or environment) affects the distribution of mutation effects on fitness and thus adaptation. Both have received some empirical validation. This article aims at bridging the gap between these approaches. A derivation of the Fisher model “from first principles” is proposed, where the basic assumptions emerge from a more general model, inspired by mechanistic networks. I start from a general phenotypic network relating unspecified phenotypic traits and fitness. A limited set of qualitative assumptions is then imposed, mostly corresponding to known features of phenotypic networks: a large set of traits is pleiotropically affected by mutations and determines a much smaller set of traits under optimizing selection. Otherwise, the model remains fairly general regarding the phenotypic processes involved or the distribution of mutation effects affecting the network. A statistical treatment and a local approximation close to a fitness optimum yield a landscape that is effectively the isotropic Fisher model or its extension with a single dominant phenotypic direction. The fit of the resulting alternative distributions is illustrated in an empirical data set. These results bear implications on the validity of Fisher’s model’s assumptions and on which features of mutation fitness effects may vary (or not) across genomic or environmental contexts.},

@article{poon2000compensating,
  abstract = {We have investigated the reduction of fitness caused by the fixation of new deleterious mutations in small
populations within the framework of Fisher’s geometrical model of adaptation. In Fisher’s model, a population evolves
in an n-dimensional character space with an adaptive optimum at the origin. The model allows us to investigate
compensatory mutations, which restore fitness losses incurred by other mutations, in a context-dependent manner. We
have conducted a moment analysis of the model, supplemented by the numerical results of computer simulations. The
mean reduction of fitness (i.e., expected load) scaled to one is approximately n/(n 1 2N e ), where N e is the effective
population size. The reciprocal relationship between the load and N e implies that the fixation of deleterious mutations
is unlikely to cause extinction when there is a broad scope for compensatory mutations, except in very small populations.
Furthermore, the dependence of load on n implies that pleiotropy plays a large role in determining the extinction risk
of small populations. Differences and similarities between our results and those of a previous study on the effects of
N e and n are explored. That the predictions of this model are qualitatively different from studies ignoring compensatory
mutations implies that we must be cautious in predicting the evolutionary fate of small populations and that additional
data on the nature of mutations is of critical importance.},

@article{barton1990pleiotropic,
  abstract = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal.

  abstract = {The fitness landscape defines the relationship between genotypes and fitness in a given environment and underlies fundamental quantities such as the distribution of selection coefficient and the magnitude and type of epistasis. A better understanding of variation in landscape structure across species and environments is thus necessary to understand and predict how populations will adapt. An increasing number of experiments investigate the properties of fitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with combinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes. Yet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space of all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used to identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based on Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns and use this flexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including Fisher{\textquoteright}s model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing nine diverse biological systems. Despite uncertainty owing to the small size of most published empirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar biological systems. Surprisingly, goodness-of-fit tests reveal that this class of phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting experimental data, is a plausible in only three of nine biological systems. More precisely, although Fisher{\textquoteright}s model was able to explain several statistical properties of the landscapes{\textemdash}including the mean and SD of selection and epistasis coefficients{\textemdash}it was often unable to explain the full structure of fitness landscapes.},

@article{lande1976natural,
  abstract = {The present paper is an attempt to provide a set of models which will be more useful in the analysis of macro-evolutionary events than the classical models of population genetics. This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W̄) in the phenotype space. Frequency-dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency-dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution.},
