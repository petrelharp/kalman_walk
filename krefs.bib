The problem of parameter identifiability for such systems is approached by considering whether system outputs obtained with different parameter values can be distinguished one from another. The results are stated formally by defining the notion of "output distinguishability." Parameter identifiability is then defined precisely in terms of output distinguishability. Relationships have been developed with the other definitions such as least square identifiability and identifiability from the transfer function. Several results for linear and nonlinear systems are presented with examples.},

  abstract="A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 − 10 = 70% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these “functional” regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used “causal role” definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as “affirming the consequent,” by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between “junk DNA” and “garbage DNA,” by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten."

  abstract="In a recent opinion piece, Denis Duboule has claimed that the increasing shift towards systems biology is driving evolutionary and developmental biology apart, and that a true reunification of these two disciplines within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) may easily take another 100 years. He identifies methodological, epistemological, and social differences as causes for this supposed separation. Our article provides a contrasting view. We argue that Duboule’s prediction is based on a one-sided understanding of systems biology as a science that is only interested in functional, not evolutionary, aspects of biological processes. Instead, we propose a research program for an evolutionary systems biology, which is based on local exploration of the configuration space in evolving developmental systems. We call this approach—which is based on reverse engineering, simulation, and mathematical analysis—the natural history of configuration space. We discuss a number of illustrative examples that demonstrate the past success of local exploration, as opposed to global mapping, in different biological contexts. We argue that this pragmatic mode of inquiry can be extended and applied to the mathematical analysis of the developmental repertoire and evolutionary potential of evolving developmental mechanisms and that evolutionary systems biology so conceived provides a pragmatic epistemological framework for the EvoDevo synthesis."

  abstract="Most complex trait-associated variants are located in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome, where they have been shown to disrupt transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs. Variable TF-DNA interactions are therefore increasingly considered as key drivers of phenotypic variation. However, recent genome-wide studies revealed that the majority of variable TF-DNA binding events are not driven by sequence alterations in the motif of the studied TF. This observation implies that the molecular mechanisms underlying TF-DNA binding variation and, by extrapolation, inter-individual phenotypic variation are more complex than originally anticipated. Here, we summarize the findings that led to this important paradigm shift and review proposed mechanisms for local, proximal, or distal genetic variation-driven variable TF-DNA binding. In addition, we discuss the biomedical implications of these findings for our ability to dissect the molecular role(s) of non-coding genetic variants in complex traits, including disease susceptibility."

  abstract="The basic body plan and major physiological axes have been highly conserved during mammalian evolution, yet only a small fraction of the human genome sequence appears to be subject to evolutionary constraint. To quantify cis- versus trans-acting contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining ~8.6 million transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is ~95% similar with that derived from human TF footprints. However, only ~20% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity."

We found that the mouse and human genomes have undergone extensive cis-regulatory rewiring that combines branch-specific evolutionary innovation and loss with widespread repurposing of conserved DHSs to alternative cell fates, and that this process is mediated by turnover of transcription factor (TF) recognition elements. Despite pervasive evolutionary remodeling of the location and content of individual cis-regulatory regions, within orthologous mouse and human cell types the global fraction of regulatory DNA bases encoding recognition sites for each TF has been strictly conserved.

  abstract="Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data."

  abstract="Cryptic genetic variants that do not typically influence traits can interact epistatically with each other and mutations to cause unexpected phenotypes. To improve understanding of the genetic architectures and molecular mechanisms that underlie these interactions, we comprehensively dissected the genetic bases of 17 independent instances of the same cryptic colony phenotype in a yeast cross. In eight cases, the phenotype resulted from a genetic interaction between a de novo mutation and one or more cryptic variants. The number and identities of detected cryptic variants depended on the mutated gene. In the nine remaining cases, the phenotype arose without a de novo mutation due to two different classes of higher-order genetic interactions that only involve cryptic variants. Our results may be relevant to other species and disease, as most of the mutations and cryptic variants identified in our study reside in components of a partially conserved and oncogenic signalling pathway."

  abstract="Genetic heterogeneity occurs when individuals express similar phenotypes as a result of different underlying mechanisms. Although such heterogeneity is known to be a potential source of unexplained heritability in genetic mapping studies, its prevalence and molecular basis are not fully understood. Here we show that substantial genetic heterogeneity underlies a model phenotype—the ability to grow invasively—in a cross of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The heterogeneous basis of this trait across genotypes and environments makes it difficult to detect causal loci with standard genetic mapping techniques. However, using selective genotyping in the original cross, as well as in targeted backcrosses, we detected four loci that contribute to differences in the ability to grow invasively. Identification of causal genes at these loci suggests that they act by changing the underlying regulatory architecture of invasion. We verified this point by deleting many of the known transcriptional activators of invasion, as well as the gene encoding the cell surface protein Flo11 from five relevant segregants and showing that these individuals differ in the genes they require for invasion. Our work illustrates the extensive genetic heterogeneity that can underlie a trait and suggests that regulatory rewiring is a basic mechanism that gives rise to this heterogeneity."

  abstract="Some genetic polymorphisms have phenotypic effects that are masked under most conditions, but can be revealed by mutations or environmental change. The genetic and molecular mechanisms that suppress and uncover these cryptic genetic variants are important to understand. Here, we show that a single mutation in a yeast cross causes a major phenotypic change through its genetic interactions with two specific combinations of cryptic variants in six genes. This result suggests that in some cases cryptic variants themselves play roles in revealing their own phenotypic effects through their genetic interactions with each other and the mutations that reveal them. We also demonstrate that most of the genes harboring cryptic variation in our system are transcription factors, a finding that supports an important role for perturbation of gene regulatory networks in the uncovering of cryptic variation. As a final part of our study, we interrogate how a mutation exposes combinations of cryptic variants and obtain evidence that it does so by disrupting the silencing of one or more genes that must be expressed for the cryptic variants to exert their effects. To prove this point, we delete the transcriptional repressor that mediates this silencing and demonstrate that this deletion reveals a similar set of cryptic variants to the ones that were discovered in the initial mutant background. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that reveal cryptic variation."

I focus on genetic and molecular evidence, which provides us with an almost-complete picture of the regulatory interactions responsible for trunk gap gene expression. I discuss the regulatory mechanisms involved, and highlight the remaining ambiguities and gaps in the evidence. This is followed by a brief discussion of molecular regulatory mechanisms for transcriptional regulation, as well as precision and size-regulation provided by the system. Finally, I discuss evidence on the evolution of gap gene expression from species other than Drosophila. My survey concludes that studies of the gap gene system continue to reveal interesting and important new insights into the role of gene regulatory networks in development and evolution."

  abstract="Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks."

The transcription networks of well-studied microorganisms appear to be made up of a small set of recurring regulation patterns, called network motifs. The same network motifs have recently been found in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans, suggesting that they serve as basic building blocks of transcription networks. Here I review network motifs and their functions, with an emphasis on experimental studies. Network motifs in other biological networks are also mentioned, including signalling and neuronal networks."

  abstract="Many signaling systems show adaptation—the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks."

An important purpose of mathematical models in evolutionary research, as in many other fields, is to act as “proof-of-concept” tests of the logic in verbal explanations, paralleling the way in which empirical data are used to test hypotheses. Because not all subfields of biology use mathematics for this purpose, misunderstandings of the function of proof-of-concept modeling are common. In the hope of facilitating communication, we discuss the role of proof-of-concept modeling in evolutionary biology."

  abstract="Species-specific regulation of gene expression contributes to the development and maintenance of reproductive isolation and to species differences in ecologically important traits. A better understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape regulatory variation and divergence can be developed by comparing expression differences among species and interspecific hybrids. Once expression differences are identified, the underlying genetics of regulatory variation or divergence can be explored. With the goal of associating cis and/or trans components of regulatory divergence with differences in gene expression, overall and allele-specific expression levels were assayed genomewide in female adult heads of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrids. A greater proportion of cis differences than trans differences were identified for genes expressed in heads and, in accordance with previous studies, cis differences also explained a larger number of species differences in overall expression level. Regulatory divergence was found to be prevalent among genes associated with defense, olfaction, and among genes downstream of the Drosophila sex determination hierarchy. In addition, two genes, with critical roles in sex determination and micro RNA processing, Sxl and loqs, were identified as misexpressed in hybrid female heads, potentially contributing to hybrid incompatibility."

abstract="Cis-regulatory sequences are often composed of many low-affinity transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Determining the evolutionary and functional importance of regulatory sequence composition is impeded without a detailed knowledge of the genotype-phenotype map.

We simulate the evolution of regulatory sequences involved in Drosophila melanogaster embryo segmentation during early development. Natural selection evaluates gene expression dynamics produced by a computational model of the developmental network. We observe a dramatic decrease in the total number of transcription factor binding sites through the course of evolution. Despite a decrease in average sequence binding energies through time, the regulatory sequences tend towards organisations containing increased high affinity transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, the binding energies of separate sequence segments demonstrate ubiquitous mutual correlations through time. Fewer than 10% of initial TFBSs are maintained throughout the entire simulation, deemed ‘core’ sites. These sites have increased functional importance as assessed under wild-type conditions and their binding energy distributions are highly conserved. Furthermore, TFBSs within close proximity of core sites exhibit increased longevity, reflecting functional regulatory interactions with core sites.

In response to elevated mutational pressure, evolution tends to sample regulatory sequence organisations with fewer, albeit on average, stronger functional transcription factor binding sites. These organisations are also shaped by the regulatory interactions among core binding sites with sites in their local vicinity.

  abstract="The interplay between the yeast prototypical transcriptional activator Gal4p and the inhibitor protein Gal80p determines the transcriptional status of the genes needed for galactose utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we showed that deletion of dsg1 coding for the F box protein Dsg1/Mdm30 delayed but did not eliminate growth of yeast on galactose. Correspondingly, the impaired expression of a GAL1-LacZ reporter in the absence of Dsg1 was only apparent during an early stage of induction. The requirement for Dsg1 in induction was abrogated by the absence of Gal80p or partly bypassed by Gal4 derivatives with decreased interaction with Gal80p. A K23R mutation in the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p was also identified to alleviate the induction defect by dsg1 deletion. On the other hand, the overall accumulation of multi-ubiquitylated Gal4p was not affected by the absence of dsg1 and the induction defect with deletion of dsg1 was partly rescued by disruption of dnm1, a gene encoding a component of the mitochondria division machinery. Taken together, these results suggest that the Dsg1-mediated efficient transcription process of GAL genes may depend on the interaction status between Gal4p and Gal80p."

  abstract="The carboxy-terminal 28 amino acids of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activator protein GAL4 execute two functions--transcriptional activation and interaction with the negative regulatory protein, GAL80. Here we demonstrate that these two functions are separable by single amino acid changes within this region. We determined the sequences of four GAL4C-mutations, and characterized the abilities of the encoded GAL4C proteins to activate transcription of the galactose/melibiose regulon in the presence of GAL80 and superrepressible GAL80S alleles. One of the GAL4C mutations can be compensated by a specific GAL80S mutation, resulting in a wild-type phenotype. These results support the idea that while the GAL4 activation function tolerates at least minor alterations in the GAL4 carboxyl terminus, the GAL80-interactive function is highly sequence-specific and sensitive even to single amino acid alterations. They also argue that the GAL80S mutations affect the affinity of GAL80 for GAL4, and not the ability of GAL80 to bind inducer."

  abstract="In S. cerevisiae, following the Whole Genome Duplication (WGD), GAL1-encoded galactokinase retained its signal transduction function but lost basal expression. On the other hand, its paralogue GAL3, lost kinase activity but retained its signalling function and basal expression, thus making it indispensable for the rapid induction of the S. cerevisiae GAL switch. However, a gal3Δ strain exhibits delayed growth kinetics due to the redundant signalling function of GAL1. The subfunctionalization between the paralogues GAL1 and GAL3 is due to expression divergence and is proposed to be due to the alteration in the Upstream Activating Sequences (UASG). We demonstrate that the GAL switch becomes independent of GAL3 by altering the interaction between Gal4p and Gal80p without altering the configuration of UASG. In addition to the above, the altered switch of S. cerevisiae loses ultrasensitivity and stringent glucose repression. These changes caused an increase in fitness in the disaccharide melibiose at the expense of a decrease in fitness in galactose. The above altered features of the ScGAL switch are similar to the features of the GAL switch of K. lactis that diverged from S. cerevisiae before the WGD."

However, in C. albicans, the Gal4p and UASG combination is found to regulate genes unrelated to galactose metabolism. We identified a palindromic sequence that acts to control GAL10 expression in C. albicans in the presence of galactose. This palindrome is found upstream of other Leloir-pathway genes in C. albicans, and in the absence of other regulatory sequences, activation of expression through this sequence in the presence of galactose requires Cph1p, the homolog of the Ste12p transcription factor of S. cerevisiae."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcriptional regulator Gal4 binds and activates these genes. In the human pathogen Candida albicans (which last shared a common ancestor with S. cerevisiae some 300 million years ago), we show that different regulators, Rtg1 and Rtg3, activate the three GAL genes. Using single-cell dynamics and RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that although the overall logic of regulation is the same in both species—the GAL genes are induced by galactose—there are major differences in both the quantitative response of these genes to galactose and in the position of these genes in the overall transcription network structure of the two species."

Transcription of the ribosomal regulon is a critical task for all cells; in S. cerevisiae the transcription factors Rap1, Fhl1, Ifh1, and Hmo1 form a multi-subunit complex that controls ribosomal gene expression, while in C. albicans this regulation is under the control of Tbf1 and Cbf1. Here, we analyzed, using full-genome transcription factor mapping, the roles, in both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, of each orthologous component of this complete set of regulators. We observe dramatic changes in the binding profiles of the generalist regulators Cbf1, Hmo1, Rap1, and Tbf1, while the Fhl1-Ifh1 dimer is the only component involved in ribosomal regulation in both fungi: it activates ribosomal protein genes and rDNA expression in a Tbf1-dependent manner in C. albicans and a Rap1-dependent manner in S. cerevisiae. We show that the transcriptional regulatory network governing the ribosomal expression program of two related yeast species has been massively reshaped in cis and trans. Changes occurred in transcription factor wiring with cellular functions, movements in transcription factor hierarchies, DNA-binding specificity, and regulatory complexes assembly to promote global changes in the architecture of the fungal transcriptional regulatory network."
