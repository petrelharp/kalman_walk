To-do list from 8/31/17:
========================

- revise back-of-the-envelope argument in "rate of speciation" section 
    to say how it's an upper bound on the speed of speciation
- add plot from an example of phenotype change against evolutionary time
- add to this (superimposed) intrapopulation variation
- come to some conclusion with "parameter estimates" section
